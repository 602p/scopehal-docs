\chapter{Main Window}

The only fixed UI elements in ngscopeclient are the main menu and toolbar at the top of the window. All remaining space
may be filled with waveform plots, properties dialogs, protocol analyzers, and other dockable windows as required for a
given experimental setup. This flexibility allows almost the entire screen to be dedicated to waveform views, or more
space allocated to controls and protocol decodes.
