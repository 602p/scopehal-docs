\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Key Concepts}

glscopeclient and libscopehal are based on a ``filter graph" architecture internally. The filter graph is a directed
acyclic graph with a set of source nodes (waveforms captured from hardware or loaded from a saved session) and sink
nodes (waveform views, protocol analyzer views, and statistics) connected by edges representing data flow.

A filter is simply an intermediate node in the graph, which takes input from one or more waveform nodes and outputs a
waveform which may be displayed, used as input to other filters, or both. A waveform is a series of data points which
may represent voltages, digital samples, or arbitrarily complex protocol data structures.

As a result, there is no internal distinction between math functions, measurements, and protocol decodes, and it is
possible to chain them arbitrarily. Consider the following example:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two analog waveforms representing serial data and clock are acquired
\item Each analog waveform is thresholded, producing a digital waveform
\item The two digital waveforms are decoded as $I^2C$, producing a series of packets
\item The $I^2C$ packets are decoded as writes to a serial DAC, producing an analog waveform
\item A moving average filter is applied to the analog waveform
\item A measurement filter finds the instantaneous frequency of each cycle of the DAC output
\end{itemize}

In this document we use the term ``filter" consistently to avoid ambiguity.

\subsection{Conventions}

Each filter takes one or more inputs (vector inputs), zero or more parameters (scalar inputs), and outputs a
signal (vector output).

If the output signal is a complex-valued type (as opposed to a single scalar, e.g. voltage, at each sample) the
``Output Signal" section will include a table describing how various types of output data are displayed. Printf-style
format codes maybe used for clarity. For example, ``\%02x" means data is formatted as hexadecimal bytes with leading
zeroes.

All filters with complex output use a standardized set of colors to display various types of data fields in a
consistent manner. These colors are configurable under the \menustyle{Appearance / Decodes} preferences category.

\section{64b/66b}
\label{filter:64b66b}

Decodes the 64/66b line code used by \hyperref[filter:10gbaser]{10Gbase-R} and other serial protocols, as originally
specified in IEEE 802.3 clause 49.2.

64b/66b is a serial line code which divides transmitted data into 64-bit blocks and scrambles them with a LFSR, then
appends a 2-bit type field (which is not scrambled) to each block for synchronization. Block synchronization depends on
always having an edge in the type field so types 2'b00 and 2'b11 are disallowed.

Note that this filter only performs block alignment and descrambling. No decoding is applied to the 64-bit blocks, as
different upper-layer protocols assign different meaning to them. In 10Gbase-R, type 2'b01 denotes ``64 bits of upper
layer data" and type 2'b10 denotes ``8-bit type field and 56 bits of data whose meaning depends on the type", however
this is not universal.

\section{8B/10B (IBM)}
\label{filter:8b10b}

Decodes the standard 8b/10b line code used by SGMII, \hyperref[filter:1000basex]{1000base-X}, DisplayPort, JESD204,
\hyperref[filter:pcie2_logical]{PCIe gen 1/2}, SATA, USB 3.0, and many other common serial protocols.

8b/10b is a dictionary based code which converts each byte of message data to a ten-bit code. In order to maintain DC
balance and limit run length to a maximum of five identical bits in a row, all legal codes have one of:
\begin{itemize}
\item One legal coding, with exactly five zero bits
\item Two legal codings, one with four zero bits and one with six
\end{itemize}

The transmitter maintains a ``running disparity" counter and chooses the appropriate coding for each symbol to ensure
DC balance. There are twelve legal codes which are not needed for encoding data values; these are used to encode
frame boundaries, idle/alignment sequences, and other control information.

\section{8B/10B (TMDS)}
\label{filter:tmds}

Decodes the 8-to-10 Transition Minimized Differential Signalling line code used in \hyperref[filter:dvi]{DVI} and HDMI.

Like the \hyperref[filter:8b10b]{8B/10B (IBM)} line code, TMDS is an 8-to-10 bit serial line code. TMDS, however, is
designed to \emph{minimize} the number of toggles in the data stream for EMC reasons, rendering it difficult to
synchronize a CDR PLL to. As a result, HDMI and DVI provide a reference clock at the pixel clock rate (1/10 the serial
data bit rate) along with the data stream to provide synchronization.

\section{AC Couple}
\label{filter:accouple}

Automatically removes a DC offset from an analog waveform by subtracting the average of all samples from each sample.

This filter should only be used in postprocessing already acquired data, or other situations in which AC coupling in
the hardware (via an AC coupled probe, or coaxial DC block) is not possible.

\section{Autocorrelation}
\label{filter:autocorrelation}

This filter calculates the autocorrelation of an analog waveform. Autocorrelation is a measure of self-similarity
calculated by multiplying the signal with a time-shifted copy of itself. In Fig. \ref{filter_accouple}, strong peaks
can be seen at multiples of the 8b/10b symbol rate.

For best performance, it is crucial to keep the maximum offset as low as possible, since filter run time grows linearly
with offset range.

\section{Base}
\label{filter:base}

Calculates the base (logical zero level) of each cycle in a digital waveform.

It is most commonly used as an input to statistics, to view the average base of the entire waveform. At times, however,
it may be useful to view the base waveform. For example, in Fig. \ref{filter_base}, the vertical eye closure caused by
channel ISI is readily apparent.

\section{Channel Emulation}
\label{filter:channelemu}

This filter models the effects of applying an arbitrary channel, described via one or more 2-port S-parameter files, to
a waveform. Fig. \ref{filter_channelemu} shows the result of passing a 1.25 Gbps serial data pattern through a 10x
oscilloscope probe with approximately 500 MHz bandwidth. The ISI, attenuation, and phase shift introduced by the
channel can all be seen.

Only the forward path (S21) is considered in the current implementation of this filter; it is assumed that any
reflected power is absorbed by terminations at the transmitter. Channels with significant return loss reflecting off
the transmitter may not be modeled accurately.

The channel model works in the frequency domain. An FFT is performed on the input, then each complex point is
scaled by the interpolated S21 magnitude and rotated by the S21 phase, then an inverse FFT is used to transform the
signal back into the time domain. The group delay of the channel is estimated and samples are discarded from the
beginning of the waveform to prevent causality violations.

Decodes one or two analog channels to MIPI D-PHY symbols (HS/LS line states). Either the positive half, or both
positive and negative, of the pair may be provided.

If only the positive half is provided, it is possible to decode HS data and clocks, but not the LP-01 and LP-10 states,
as these are indistinguishable from LP-00 and LP-11. This prevents proper decoding of Escape Mode data, although
Start-Of-Transmission sequences may be inferred from context.

\section{PCIe Data Link}

Decodes the Data Link layer of PCI Express. At this layer DLLPs are fully decoded. TLP sequence numbers are visible
and CRC16s are checked, however TLP content is displayed as hex dumps.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\pagebreak
\section{PCIe Gen 1/2 Logical}

Decodes the Logical Sub-Block of the PCI Express 1.0 and 2.0 PHY. This layer decodes 8B/10B symbols and the LFSR
scrambler. TLP and DLLP start/end markers are identified but no packet decoding is performed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\pagebreak
\section{PCIe Transport}

Decodes the Transport layer of PCI Express. At this layer TLPs are fully decoded, however only a unidirectional view
of the system is visible (only TX or only RX).

\section{Windowed Autocorrelation}

Calculates the cross-correlation between a fixed size block of the input signal and another block of the same size.

This will produce maximal response for a signal which has periodicity with the specified period and block size.

For example, period 4 and block size 2 will match aa**aa**.

This can be used to identify OFDM symbols.
