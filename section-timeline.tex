\section{Timeline}

The timeline is displayed at the top of each waveform group and shows the X axis scale for the group. The timeline (and
all accompanying waveform views in the group) may be zoomed by scrolling with the mouse wheel, or panned by dragging
with the left mouse button.

Unlike classical oscilloscope user interfaces, there is \emph{no relationship} between the timeline scale/position and
the duration of the acquisition. It is possible to zoom or scroll beyond the end of the acquisition (displaying empty
background with no signal) or have a deep capture in which nearly all acquired data is offscreen.

TODO: talk about how to set trigger offset in capture and change timebase once that's implemented

TODO: insert screenshot after we have some pending UI changes done
