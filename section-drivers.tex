\section{Oscilloscope Drivers}
\label{sec:drivers}

\subsection{Agilent}

Agilent devices support a similar similar SCPI command set across most device families.

Please see the table below for details of current hardware support:

\begin{tabularx}{16cm}{llX}
\thickhline
\textbf{Device Family} & \textbf{Driver} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\thickhline
DSO5000 series & agilent & Not recently tested, but should work.\\
\thickhline
DSO6000 \& MSO6000 series & agilent &  Working. No support for digital channels yet.\\
\thickhline
DSO7000 \& MSO7000 series & agilent &  Untested, but should work. No support for digital channels yet.\\
\thickhline
\end{tabularx}

\subsubsection{agilent}

Example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
./glscopeclient --debug myscope:agilent:lan:192.168.1.1:5025
\end{lstlisting}

This driver has been tested on an MSO6034A.

\subsection{Antikernel Labs}

\begin{tabularx}{16cm}{llX}
\thickhline
\textbf{Device Family} & \textbf{Driver} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\thickhline
Internal Logic Analyzer IP & akila & \\
\thickhline
BLONDEL Oscilloscope Prototype & aklabs & \\
\thickhline
\end{tabularx}

\subsubsection{akila}

This driver uses a raw binary protocol, not SCPI.

Under-development internal logic analyzer analyzer core for FPGA design debug. The ILA uses a UART interface to a host
system. Since there's no UART support in scopehal yet, socat must be used to bridge the UART to a TCP socket using
the ``lan" transport.

\subsubsection{aklabs}

This driver uses two TCP sockets. Port 5025 is used for SCPI control plane traffic, and port 50101 is used for waveform
data using a raw binary protocol.

\subsection{Rigol}

Rigol oscilloscopes have subtle differences in SCPI command set, but this is implemented with quirks handling in the
driver rather than needing different drivers for each scope family.

\begin{tabularx}{16cm}{llX}
\thickhline
\textbf{Device Family} & \textbf{Driver} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\thickhline
DS1000Z & rigol & \\
\thickhline
MSO5000 & rigol & \\
\thickhline
\end{tabularx}

\subsubsection{rigol}

This driver has been primarily tested on a MSO5000 series scope.

\subsection{Siglent}

Many recent Siglent oscilloscopes are developed in partnership with Teledyne LeCroy (Siglent-designed hardware running
Teledyne LeCroy firmware) and are sold under both brands. As a result, there is some crossover in driver support. \\

\begin{tabularx}{16cm}{lllX}
\thickhline
\textbf{Device Family} & \textbf{Driver} & \textbf{Transport} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\thickhline
SDS5000X series & siglent & lxi, lan & Untested \\
\thickhline
SDS2000X Plus series & siglent & lxi, lan & Untested \\
\thickhline
SDS2000X-E series & siglent & lxi, lan & Untested \\
\thickhline
SDS2000X series & siglent & lxi & Base functionality present, tested on SDS2304X. \\
\thickhline
SDS1000X series & siglent & lxi & Untested \\
\thickhline
SDS1000X+ series & siglent & lxi & Untested \\
\thickhline
SDS1000X-E series & siglent & lxi, lan & Base functionality present, lan transport tested on SDS1204X-E.\\
\thickhline
SDS1000CFL series & siglent & ? & Untested \\
\thickhline
SDS1000DL+ series & siglent & lxi & Untested \\
\thickhline
SDS1000CML+ series & siglent & lxi & Untested \\
\thickhline
SDS3000X series & lecroy & vicp & Should be same as WaveSurfer 3000 \\
\end{tabularx}

Unlike TCP/IP sockets (``lan"), VXI-11 (``lxi") is a synchronous protocol that  does not support
queueing multiple transactions. When an oscilloscope supports both the lan and the lxi transport,
chances are that the lan transport will have a better performance than the lxi transport.

\subsection{Teledyne LeCroy / LeCroy}

Teledyne LeCroy (and older LeCroy) devices use the same driver, but two different transports for LAN connections.

While all Teledyne LeCroy / LeCroy devices use almost identical SCPI command sets, Windows based devices running
XStream or MAUI use a custom framing protocol (``vicp") around the SCPI data while the lower end RTOS based devices use
raw SCPI over TCP (``lan"). Some of these devices also require use of the Siglent driver as they are Siglent OEM
designs rebranded by Teledyne LeCroy and have some quirks in the firmware which require workarounds.

Please see the table below for details on which configuration to use with  your hardware.

\begin{tabularx}{16cm}{lllX}
\thickhline
\textbf{Device Family} & \textbf{Driver} & \textbf{Transport} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\thickhline
DDA & lecroy & vicp & \\
\thickhline
HDO & lecroy & vicp & \\
\thickhline
LabMaster & lecroy & vicp & Untested, but should work\\
\thickhline
MDA & lecroy & vicp & Untested, but should work\\
\thickhline
SDA & lecroy & vicp & Untested, but should work\\
\thickhline
T3DSO & siglent & lan & Untested, but should work\\
\thickhline
WaveAce & siglent & lan & Untested, but should work \\
\thickhline
WaveJet & siglent & lan & Untested, but should work \\
\thickhline
WaveMaster & lecroy & vicp & Untested, but should work \\
\thickhline
WaveRunner & lecroy & vicp & \\
\thickhline
WaveSurfer & lecroy & vicp & \\
\thickhline
\end{tabularx}

\subsubsection{lecroy}

This is the primary driver for MAUI based Teledyne LeCroy / LeCroy devices.

Example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
./glscopeclient --debug myscope:lecroy:vicp:192.168.1.1:1861
\end{lstlisting}

This driver has been tested on a wide range of Teledyne LeCroy / LeCroy hardware including DDA 5005, DDA 5005A,
WaveSurfer 3034, WaveRunner 8104, and HDO9204. It should be compatible with any Teledyne LeCroy or LeCroy oscilloscope
running Windows XP or newer and the MAUI or XStream software.
